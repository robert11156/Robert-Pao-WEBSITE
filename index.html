   	<p>What Are Sports Drinks?</p>
   	<p>Sports drinks are a means of maintaining hydration, and electrolyte and glucose levels during exercise. 
   	An athlete loses about a liter of water per hour through sweat. Since a 2 percent loss of body weight from 
   	sweat can lead to a 10 percent performance decrease, it is important for athletes to keep up with hydration. 
   	Electrolytes are responsible for maintaining the proper mineral levels for nervous system function and muscle 
   	contractions. Glucose (a carbohydrate) provides more than half of the energy for intense exercise. The body only 
   	stores enough glucose for about 90 minutes of exercise. After that, an athlete maintains glucose levels by consuming 
   	carbohydrates during exercise.</p>
   	<p>Carbohydrates in Sports Drinks</p>
   	<p>Sugars are immediately available to working muscles, making them a good source of energy during exercise. 
   	However, too much sugar interferes with water absorption. A University of Texas study found that solutions of 
   	4 percent to 8 percent carbohydrates optimized water and carbohydrate absorption. Both Gatorade and Powerade 
   	are within this range, with Gatorade offering a 6 percent solution and Powerade 8 percent. In addition to glucose, 
   	Powerade derives 12 percent of its carbohydrates from sugar polymers, though it is unclear if polymers act any 
   	differently than glucose once inside the body.</p>
   	<p>That even though Powerade and Gatorade have the same ending, Pepsi owns Gatorade and Coke owns Powerade.</p>
